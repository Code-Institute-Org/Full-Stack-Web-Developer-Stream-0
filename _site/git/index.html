<h1 id="git">Git</h1>

<p>Why do we need it? If you’re working on a small project that’s all yours, and you don’t plan to share it with anyone else, then Version Control may not really be an issue.
However, the days when an individual designs and develops a professional project on his or her own are all but gone. 
You can manage changes by yourself without too much difficulty, but when others become involved – things can get tricky pretty quick.
This wouldn’t be so bad if there was a clean separation of responsibilities. At first you might think that when you’re finished with your part of a project, 
you’ll send it off to your colleague Sarah to finish. But this is not practical for a number of reasons. 
Much of the time you’ll find yourself working on projects – and even files – concurrently with others. 
Version Control allows a team to work synchronously. It helps the team cope with the confusion that arises from multiple people editing the same files.
Git is a version control system created by Linus Torvalds (who also happens to be the creator of Linux). He named this version control system after himself.
When using Git, you and Sarah can each work on separate visions of a project and Git will save two distinct copies. Later, you can merge your changes together without losing any of your precious work. If you later realise you made a horrible mistake, you can revert to an earlier version at any time. Git keeps a “snapshot” of every change ever made. Hurray!
This is the essence of version control and Git does it very well indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A command line interface is a means used for interacting with software or files by typing commands to perform specific tasks. 
The command line interface is the baby brother of programming languages. 
Learning the command line teaches you to control the computer using language rather than mouse-clicking on icons trees and folders.
You’ll need to get the basics in place in order to use Git</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to GitHub! By reading these Stream 0 documents you are already taking your first steps into the world of hosted social version control.
You can see the documents created and the history of all the edits, additions, deletes and formatting used to put all of this together</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub is not strictly a development tool – it can be thought of as a social network for documents. 
You build a profile, upload projects to share, and connect with other users. You can even follow other user accounts. 
While many users store code projects, there’s nothing stopping you from using Github to store your favourite recipes or anything else you want.
Strictly speaking, we don’t need to know coding to use GitHub. We can sign up and explore, but we would be missing the point. 
As developers, to get the real benefit we need to get our hands dirty with Git. GitHub is based around the Git version control system.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a GitHub software download for Windows and Mac, which has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to help you manage your projects locally.
More importantly, by registering with GitHub.com, your projects can be uploaded to the Web, shared, and collaborated on with others. 
You can browse other GitHub users’ projects, and even download copies for yourself to alter and learn from. 
Other users can do the same with your public projects, and even spot errors and suggest fixes. Either way, no data is lost because a snapshot is made of every change.</p>
